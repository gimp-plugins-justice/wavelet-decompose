The wavelet decompose plugin decomposes a layer of an image into layers of
wavelet scales. This means that you can edit the image on different detail
scales (frequencies). The trivial recomposition of the image can be done by
GIMP's layer modes so you can see the results of your modifications instantly.
Among the applications are retouching, noise reduction, and enhancing global
contrast.

Wavelet scales:

An image can be transformed into a set of wavelet scales. There are detail
scales and one residual. The detail scales contain the image details of a their
scale size. This means that scale 1 contains only image details of the smallest
scale. Scale 2 details are larger and scale 3 details even larger (and so on).

This plugin computes these scales and creates a new layer for each one. The
recomposition is the addition off all scales which is done by GIMP using the
grain merge layer mode. You can then paint the scales with your favourite tool,
using (128,128,128) as neutral colour (for the details, not the residual).
Values below neutral darken, values above lighten. The most straightforward
thing to do is to use the paintbrush tool with the  neutral colour and use
different brushes and opacities. That way you erase details.
